# Asteroids
The well known Asteroids game, coded in pure JS with no libraries.
The code was rendered with the use of HTML canvas. 

### How to run the game
Just open the index.html file, there's no additional assets, everything is rendered on screen

### Controls
Arrow keys - up, down, left, right<br>
Z - rotate to the left<br>
C - rotate to the right<br>
X - lauch rocket<br>

### Rules 
-Destoy as many asteroids as you possibly can<br>
-The asteroids have between 1 and 4 lives<br>
-For every 50 points, you get one more life<br>
-If you find the game too easy, go to the "setInterval" function, and change the asteroid spawn rate<br>

### Why do it?
It's a fun way of testing the limits of JS as a language. While there are libraries and frameworks meant to make game development easy using JS, I wanted to see what the language was capable of all by itself.
